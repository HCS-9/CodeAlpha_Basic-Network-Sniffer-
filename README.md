# CodeAlpha_Basic-Network-Sniffer-
This project is a basic network sniffer written in Python using the Scapy library. It captures real-time network packets and displays useful information like source and destination IPs, ports, protocols, and payloads. The goal is to understand how data flows through the network and analyze the packet structure.
